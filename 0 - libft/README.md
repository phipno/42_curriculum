📚 #Libft: My Custom Standard C Library Implementation 📚

🔍 ##Why Libft?
- _Reinventing the wheel is sometimes bad_. We gain a deeper understanding of what's happening behind the scenes in standard library functions if we first redevlope them.
- Through this project, we delve into basic algorithms and data structures, laying a strong foundation for future endeavors.
