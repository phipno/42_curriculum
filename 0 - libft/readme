# Libft
My own Standard C Library implementation.

### Why libft?
This project needs us to re-create some standard C library functions including some additional ones so we can use them later on in bigger projects.
To the case of why: *Reinventing the wheel is bad. We get a deeper understanding of whats going on behind the scene, we get to understand basic algorithms and data structures.

My code is not the cleanest and best documented, but it passed all the 42 tests successfully.
