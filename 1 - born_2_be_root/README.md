# 💽 born_2_be_root: My First Virtual Machine 💽

### 🔍 Why born_2_be_root?
Born_2_be_root is my first venture into setting up a virtual environment. I opted for Debian, with a non-graphical installation.
- Installation Challenges: Setting up the virtual environment posed a problem, because of given limitations on our school's Mac computers.
- User and Password Management: Once installed, I needed to work out the user, group, and password management.
- Tool Configuration: Configuring essential tools like SSH and a firewall (UFW).
- Monitoring Scripts: Coded a little monitoring script which monitored system activitie.
- Preparation for Evaluation: Finally, I prepared for evaluation which had a lot of question about the topic Virtual Machines.
 
### ❌ Why are there no files?
Cause pushing a virtual machine into github would be weird and sadly i dont have the Script anymore.
